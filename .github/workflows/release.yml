# A Workflow for triggering a new release.
#
# Releasing is a two-stage process.
# 1. Running this workflow will check the build is green and then push a release tag to the repo, e.g., v1.2.3
# 2. Pushing the release tag will trigger the main build.yml.
#    This main build has conditional steps to publish artifacts when building a tag
